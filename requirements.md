# Dog API Microservice 

We need a microservice that is in a docker container that we can use to support interacting with the Dog Api via secured endpoint. We will be using the existing Dog Api and wrapping it behind our own Api. We want this new Api to use all of the industry standard best practices, unit testing, build pipelines and docker. 

We want our microservice to be designed so that the source of the dog Api, logins, logging system and di provider can be swapped out if we need to align with another organization or another business unit in the organization.

* API Docs 
    * Use: Swagger 
    * Generate documentation for the endpoints 
* Request Validation 
    * Using: FluentValidation 
    * Validate incoming requests and return meaningful messages and status codes 
    * Resources: 
        * https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation  
* Auth and Auth 
    * Create a basic user storage solution 
    * SHAW256 hash of password 
    * Salt password 
    * Store secret in Azure Key Vault 
    * Try to integrate with IConfiguration 
    * Secure endpoints 
    * Most users are in the standard group, but the ListAllBreeds endpoint needs to be secured with an Admin group which a limited number of users are in 
* Configuration 
    * Using: Azure App Configuration 
    * Store things about the application like the log level 
    * Using Microsoftâ€™s IConfiguration technology to overlay the cloud config with a local Json file to enable local building and testing 
        * This file should be excluded from the Docker image 
* Docker 
    * Site builds into an alpine (Linux) instance 
    * Runs as a dedicated user (not root) 
    * Clear out anything not needed to run service from final image layer 
    * Use .dockerignore file 
    * Resources: 
        * https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/
* Docker Compose
    * Create a docker-compose file to run the API and Seq
    * Resources: 
        * https://docs.docker.com/compose/
* Logging 
    * Using Serilog 
    * Structured Logging (Json) 
    * Using Seq for log management
